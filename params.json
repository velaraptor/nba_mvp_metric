{"name":"Predicting Voting Behavior For the NBA Most Valuable Player","tagline":"","body":"NBA MVP Metric\r\n==============\r\nBy Christopher Vela and Daniel Schwartz\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n===============\r\nLink to PDF: [adafinalproject%20(1).pdf](https://github.com/velaraptor/nba_mvp_metric/blob/master/pdf%20report/adafinalproject%20(1).pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\nAt the end of each season, the National Basketball Association designates the most valuable player\r\n(MVP) based on a voting system whereby broadcasters and journalists rank the ﬁve best performing players. Points are then assigned inversely with rank for each ballot cast. The rank-point\r\nequivalencies are as follows:\r\n\r\nrank for a given ballot points\r\n\r\n1st: 10\r\n\r\n2nd: 7\r\n\r\n3rd: 5\r\n\r\n4th: 3\r\n\r\n5th: 1\r\n\r\nThe award is given to the player receiving the most points.\r\nIn recent years, the MVP has been the subject of much criticism from fans and sports commenta-\r\ntors. Wrote Fansided writer Phil Daniels: “The NBA fails to concretely deﬁne the criteria for the\r\nMaurice Podoloﬀ Trophy winner. The only criterion is that the MVP is awarded annually to the\r\n’most valuable player.’ Value is not deﬁned. Scope is not limited.” Many have also claimed that\r\nthe award has become a function of player popularity and media attention rather than performance.\r\nTo investigate voting behavior, we examine historical data from 1986-2012, looking at metrics in\r\nseveral areas: player age, position, individual performance, contribution in the context of a team\r\nand salary. We assume here that player salary functions as a proxy variable for understanding\r\npopularity and overall market demand for a particular player. We narrow our focus to the sub-\r\nset of players receiving positive point counts (typically a handful of players each season). Our\r\nquestion of interest can then be distilled to: “Among the top-performing players, which character-\r\nistics best predict total points?” Data pertaining to basketball metrics, player age, position and\r\nMVP voting was drawn from www.basketball-reference.com. Player salary data was taken from\r\nwww.eskimo.com/~pbender.\r\n\r\nTwo seasons of data (1998-1999 and 2011-2012) were excluded from our analysis as player negotia-\r\ntions prevented completion of these seasons’ games. The 1987-1988 and 1990-1991 seasons were also\r\nexcluded as player salary data could not be found. Total point counts per player were normalized\r\nby the total number of points available since the total number of ballots cast diﬀers from year to\r\nyear, giving a response variable that can be interpreted as the proportion of the vote captured by a\r\nparticular player. Player salaries were normalized by the cumulative league salary for the particular\r\nyear to account for inﬂation.\r\n\r\nAfter aggregating all of the positive point-receiving players over 23 seasons we are left with a sample\r\nsize of n = 374. This method makes two important assumptions. The ﬁrst is that the tastes and\r\npreferences of the sports commentariat are roughly stable over time. To check the validity of this\r\nassumption, we will examine models for both the full 23 seasons as well as for the most recent 10\r\nseasons (n = 166). The second assumption is that the joint distribution of the covariates for players\r\nin the running for MVP are independent from year to year. This assumption becomes important\r\nas there are many recurring players in our sample.\r\n\r\nImplementation\r\n============== \r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/fF7vuQd\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fF7vuQd.png\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/AFOsKgY\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/AFOsKgY.png\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/W5goenE\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/W5goenE.png\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/Vv4qn4K\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Vv4qn4K.png\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/WJPO1EI\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/WJPO1EI.png\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/wse5WBV\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wse5WBV.png\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/z0Z9BeO\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/z0Z9BeO.png\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/nSHVudt\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/nSHVudt.png\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\"/></a>\r\n\r\nOur prediction for MVP for 2013-14 Season: 2nd column is number of games played and third column is percentage of votes attained by each player. \r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/mGtPoRK\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mGtPoRK.png\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\" /></a>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project was done for our Statistical Course W4201 at Columbia University. \r\nCopyright 2014 Christopher Vela & Daniel Schwartz\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
